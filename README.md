# Data Visualization & Statistical Analysis System

A Python-based system for **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and data visualization**. This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights using Python libraries.

---

## Project Overview

This project performs:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis using NumPy
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of trends and distributions using Matplotlib

The goal is to **communicate insights clearly through visual dashboards and plots** to support data-driven decision-making.
